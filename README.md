## Overview:
1 in 5 patients miss their hospital appointments in Brazil. 
Why should it matter?
This can lead to serious things: money lost, wasted staff time, and delayed patient care. No-shows can potentially be life threatening. 

To solve this real world problem, I worked on an **interactive Tableau dashboard** analyzing over **110,000+ medical appointments** (**22,000 no-shows**) across Brazil, uncovering key factors contributing to no-shows and provide data driven recommendations for patients to reduce the number of missed appointments and improve the efficiencies of hospitals across Brazil. 

## Problem Statement:
Challenge: 20% of the people who book appointments don't show up - that's **1 in 5 people**
Impact: Lost revenue, resources not allocated properly, patient care may face serious delays
Goal: My dashboard identifies key drives of no-shows and derives insights on how to reduce them

## Data & Tools Used:
Dataset: Medical No-Shows Appointment Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
Tools Used: Python (data cleaning and preprocessing), Excel/CSV (exploration); Tableau (dashboard and data visualization)

## Key Insights:
Females have 50% more no-shows than men!
Non-Chronic minors (under the age of 18) have the highest amount of no-shows
The no-show rate dropped by 25% from May to June

## Actionable Recommendations:
Prioritize reminder calls for Tuesday and Wednesday appointments
Outreach efforts for high-risk neighborhoods like Resistencia and Maria Ortiz
Target non-chronic minors with educational campaigns emphasizing the importance of checkups for early illness detection and improved treatment outcomes. 

## Business Impact:
Hospital Appointments in Brazil cost approximately $100 per appointment
Potential Savings in Revenue: **$223K/year**
Cost of Intervention: **$5.4K/year**
ROI: **3,850%**
**10% reduction** in no-shows = **2,232 more appointments/year (approx $223K more in revenue)**
