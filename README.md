## Overview:
1 in 5 patients miss their hospital appointments in Brazil. 
Why should it matter?
This can lead to serious things: money lost, wasted staff time, and delayed patient care. No-shows can potentially be life threatening. 

To solve this real world problem, I worked on an **interactive Tableau dashboard** analyzing over **110,000+ medical appointments** (**22,000 no-shows**) across Brazil, uncovering key factors contributing to no-shows and provide data driven recommendations for patients to reduce the number of missed appointments and improve the efficiencies of hospitals across Brazil. 

## Problem Statement:
-Challenge: 20% of the people who book appointments don't show up - that's **1 in 5 people**
-Impact: Lost revenue, resources not allocated properly, patient care may face serious delays
-Goal: My dashboard identifies key drives of no-shows and derives insights on how to reduce them

## Data & Tools Used:
-Dataset: Medical No-Shows Appointment Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
-Tools Used: Python (data cleaning and preprocessing), Excel/CSV (exploration); Tableau (dashboard and data visualization)

## Key Insights:
-Patients waiting for **more than 8 days** are **2.5x more likely to no-show**
-**SMS reminders** reduce the chances of no-shows by **44% across all the age groups**
-Patients with chronic conditions **(especially Diabetes and Hypertension)** account for **HALF of no-shows**
-Appointments scheduled **within 2 days of booking** often experience around **30% higher no-show rates** (that's almost 1 in 3 people!)

## Actionable Recommendations:
-Send **SMS reminders** a night before to patients who have booked appointments for Tuesdays and Wednesdays
-Prioritize getting **chronic patients earlier slots** (it's better for their health to be checked up earlier!)
-**Restrict the wait times to less than 7 days**; more than that = more no shows = lost revenue

## Business Impact:
-Potential Savings in Revenue: **$223K/year**
-Cost of Intervention: **$5.4K/year**
-ROI: **3,850%**
-**10% reduction** in no-shows = **2,232 more appointments/year (approx $223K more in revenue)**
