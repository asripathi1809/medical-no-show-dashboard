#What this code does: This Python script cleans and preprocesses a hospital appointment dataset, handles missing values, corrects data types, and engineers new features such as scheduled and appointment hour, weekday, and month. These processed features were then used to build an interactive Tableau dashboard. 
#Why I chose Python: I chose Python for data cleaning and feature engineering due to its readability, efficiency, and the fact that I'm very comfortable with the programming language, Additionally, it integrates well with Tableau, which helps when preparing datasets for visualization.  
#How the Tableau Dashboard helps: The dashboard provides the audience visual insights into the real-world problem of hospital appointment no shows in Brazil. It allows them to explore factors relating to no-shows such as a patient's gender, age, neighborhood, and appointment timing and hhow they relate to patients not showing up to their appointments. This dashboard aims to help healthcare staff identify patterns adds a visual sight to the real world problem of hospital no-shows, collecting insights on people who miss their appointments, as well as their age, demographics, and other factors indicating to why they may have missed their appointments. This can help healthcare staff identify patterns and make data-driven decisions on how to reduce no-shows.
